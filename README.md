## General advice  

Spend time everyday building and reinforcing computational skills. Like a foreign language, you need to use it to build mastery. Look for ways to use your new skills in various aspects of your work.

## Command Line and Bash Shell  

The command line allows you to run and automate commands on both a local computer and remote servers. While it may seem "dated" compared to our windows-oriented graphical desktops, it is incredibly powerful, and learning a few key commands will be critical for using git effectively (see below).

Installation:
- Mac: Use the `Terminal` app
- Windows: Use `gitbash`. See installation directions on [this Software Carpentry page](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/2021-08-09-uwmadison-swc/).

## Git and GitHub

Git is powerful software to track changes and work collaboratively on code, while GitHub is a public git server. We use both the git program and the GitHub server for our laboratory notebooks.

Installation:
- Mac: Open the `Terminal` app and type `git`. If the software is not already installed follow the directions to install `Command Line Tools`.
- Windows: Use `gitbash`. See installation directions on [this Software Carpentry page](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/2021-08-09-uwmadison-swc/).

## Text Editor

Instructions are provided for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but any text editor will work. Editors with git integration may be more useful.

Installation:
- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Setup:
- [Basic set up](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics)
- [Set up GitHub in VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-github-visual-studio-code/)
- [Set VS Code to be your default editor for git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git#using-visual-studio-code-as-your-editor)

## Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to format when writing in a plain text document. You gain the benefit of having the document stored in an archival format (plain text) but that can be compiled simply to a formatted document. For example, asterisks surrounding a word will make it *italics*. Here is a [friendly article](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/) about markdown formatting.

Markdown documents typically have a `.md` file extension. The text you are reading is written in markdown.

It is important to note that there are different flavors of markdown that support different types of formatting: tables, etc. The basic syntax will work in (most) of the different flavors. When in doubt, keep the formatting simple.

Installation:
- None required! Try saving a document in your text editor with the `.md` extension.
- For fancier functions in your text editor, consider installing a [Markdown extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).
- Can also experiment with Markdown format at the [Dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io) online markdown editor.

## Python

Installation: 
-  [Miniconda Python 3.x](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  

Training:
- [Data Science Hub Software Carpentry Course](https://datascience.wisc.edu/training-resources/) - Note that different courses cover different topics, so make sure the course is covering the language(s) of interest.
- [Online Python course](https://www.intelligent.com/best-online-courses/python/)  
- [Python pandas tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)
