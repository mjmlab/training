## General advice  

Spend time everyday building and reinforcing computational skills. Like a foreign language, you need to use it to build mastery. Look for ways to use your new skills in various aspects of your work and life!


## Command Line and Bash Shell  

Getting started:

Installation: For Mac, use the `Terminal` app; for Windows use `gitbash`. See installation directions on [this Software Carpentry page](https://xuf12.github.io/2015-11-10-northwesternu/).

## GitHub and Git  

### Installation  

For Mac, open the `Terminal` app and type `git`. If the software is not already installed follow the directions to install `Command Line Tools`. On Windows use `gitbash`. See installation directions on [this Software Carpentry page](https://xuf12.github.io/2015-11-10-northwesternu/).

### Training  

Beginner
- [Online git tutorial](https://try.github.io)  
- [GitHub tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Beginner/Intermediate
- [Write good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) or read a [long version](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- [Learn git branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org)

- [Vince Buffalo's Bioinformatics Data Skills Book](http://vincebuffalo.org/book/)


## Text Editor

Whatever works for you.

If you want some guidance, check out notes on [text editors](text-editors.md).


## Python

Getting started:

Installation: [Anaconda Python 3.x](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  
Tutorial: [Codecademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)  
Reference:

Becoming proficient:

[Exercism exercises](http://exercism.io)

Attaining mastery:


## Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to format when writing in a plain text document. You gain the benefit of having the document stored in an archival format (plain text) but that can be compiled simply to a formatted document. For example, asterisks surrounding a word will make it *italics*.

Here is a [friendly article](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/) to markdown formatting.

Markdown documents typically have a `.md` file extension. This text is written in markdown.

It is important to note that there are different flavors of markdown that support different types of formatting: tables, etc.

### Markdown syntax

The original [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) from John Gruber

[GitHub guide to markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), including information on [GitHub-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)

[Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Helper applications

[Dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io) online markdown editor

Many applications have viewers and plugins, e.g., [markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus) for the [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor. See our notes on [text editors](text-editors.md).

### Additional resources

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) is a versatile application for converting markdown to a variety of formats (Word, PDF, LaTeX, eBooks, etc).
